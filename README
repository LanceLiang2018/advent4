This is a port of the original Colossal Cave text adventure to UNIX

The original Fortran code was by William Crowther, with major features
added by Don Woods.  Conversion to BDS C by J. R. Jaeger and UNIX<TM>
standardization by Jerry D. Pohl. The last port to QNX 4 and bug fixes
by James Lummel.  This last version should work without any change on
HP-UX, Sun Solaris, *BSD and GNU/Linux systems.

The actual license of this program is unknown, although most people
agree that it is likely to be considered to be under the public domain.

See the files in the doc/ directory for the original documentation,
including cheat codes and some history.
